# 11/9/2025 10 PM - added power path  

_Time spent: 3.0h_  

added all of my power path stuff
flow:
usb 2.0
data goes through esd protection, to mcu data
vbus goes to BQ24075 which charges at 500mA and has two leds for status, outputs usb if connected otherwise battery
output goes to TPS61023, 5v boost to 5v rail
also goes to an ldo which outputs to 3v3 rail

# 11/9/2025 11 PM - mcu + multiplexer + sd card  

_Time spent: 1.5h_  

added mcu buttons and multiplexer (using mcp23017 bc other one is analog), and also wired the sd card. thats it basically; using i2c for multiplexer and spi for sd card

# 11/10/2025 - audio path  

_Time spent: 3.0h_  

added the audio path !!
it goes from the pcm DAC, to the pamb403 amplifier, to the 2 l, r speakers which will be 8ohm
also added a microphone that im planning to use for basic commands
misc fixes: added an ntc thermistor, pull ups to the sda/scl

# 11/11/2025 - finished schematic  

_Time spent: 3.0h_  

finished schematic; adding footprints now
found a tool called easyeda2kicad that lets me download the jlc parts footprints which makes it a lot more convenient and wouldve saved me time in creating footprints

# 11/23/2025 - finished schematic fully and starting pcb  

_Time spent: 4.0h_  

went back and forth on multiple things so this took way longer than it really needed to, since i also researched and designed like 4 things i ended up just deleting. initially i was going to just use modules for both capacitive touch and nfc because they're kind of a hassle but after seeing the size and how conflicting they would look on the pcb anyways, i decided to just have both. theyll probably both be less reliable (especially the touch sensor since im using the esp32s3 gpio which isnt even certified but oh well. new schematic:

new pcb:

i have to keep in mind all the keepout for the different components, and the size of the power traces, and routing everything properly.


  

# 11/24/2025 - added a few more sensors  

_Time spent: 2.0h_  

added temperature, humidity, color/lux sensor, magnetometer. not much more to say but im officially for real done with the schematic. i also figured out the nfc antenna, hopefully my numbers are correct.

# 11/25/2025 10 AM - routing  

_Time spent: 1.5h_  

design considerations i must follow:
- usb c at one edge
- esp32s3 antenna at other edge
- sd card on side edge
- headers on other side edge
- very minimal traces through nfc antenna
- battery connection at side edge
- two speakers; one on each edge
- microphone in middle
- imu in middle
- touch pad at edge
partial routing:

# 11/25/2025 9 PM - pcb layout done and grouped  

_Time spent: 0.5h_  

layout done and everything is now grouped and the within groups are routed. i need to route the full board now, might be terrible because i tried to minimize spacing; but hopefully it wont be like impossible. might get rid of the oled screen for just being unnecessary.

# 11/28/2025 3 PM - routing done!!  

_Time spent: 2.5h_  

finally finished routing, also added the gnd pour and stitching vias. it actually wasnt that bad, the process i did this time with grouping sections together and making a layout, and additionally giving myself some space definitely made it miles more pleasant to do. definitely couldve made this board smaller but its not like that matters for me with this board so oh well.

# 11/28/2025 6:02 PM - done !!  

_Time spent: 1.0h_  

added silkscreen, fixed the jlcpcb BOM and placements; the cost ended up being literally $199.99 which is kinda cooked, pcb assembly is so expensive especially since all the sensors are extended, and i cant get the cheap shipping because the pcba is more than $99.

# 12/1/2025 - fixed nfc  

_Time spent: 2.0h_  

completely forgot about the gnd place oops. also apparently no traces are allowed to cross the coil at all, contrary to what i read of some straight ones being allowed. so fixed the nfc antenna issues, removed capacitive touch because there's no space to put it anywhere, and also cleaned some things. moved the oled to a different spot, and now have a lot of space on my board but unfortunately not enough to actually make the board smaller. also added some test points in case i need them

# 2/10/2026 - made it work!!!  

_Time spent: 3.0h_  

i initially tried this the second it shipped but it didnt work for some reason; i thought i messed up in the i2c wiring because all three sensors i tried out from the beginning refused to give me any data. i then asked for help in 1bitsquared which is a goated community, who pointed me into using a logic analyzer which i conveniently had stashed away from a random aliexpress order many months ago. soldered the headers on and connected it to view the data, and instead found that miraculously it had started working, and after troubleshooting a lot with the board type in arduino because it would refuse to compile otherwise, i got it actually working from the code (also made a custom board for the board manager of the ide). then adapted the gpt code into the library code, and got a voc index reading by using the sensiron algorithm (note that it takes a while to warm up the sensor before getting real readings), and now it gives accurate data!! hovers around 90-120 VOC Index in my room, and when i breathe on it it spikes up to like 200 which is exactly what its supposed to be doing which is goated !! will test the other sensors later, and figure out how logic analyzer actually works
